# Rosalind Solutions

This repository contains solutions to bioinformatics coding challenges from [rosalind.info](https://rosalind.info/).

ðŸš€ Interesting fact: Rosalind Franklin was a biophysicist that worked on DNA. Her work was crucial in understanding the double helix structure of DNA. Rosalind was able to get a X-ray image of the DNA (Photo 51) that revealed that double helix structure. Watson and Crick are often credited with proposing the double helix structure of DNA, but it's Franklin's work, particularly her X-ray images, that were crucial to the understanding of DNA's structure. Unfortunately, her scientific contributions were not recognized during her lifetime, while Watson & Crick got the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine in 1962.
This is what we call the *"Matilda Effect"*: the practice of ascribing women's accomplishments to men.
